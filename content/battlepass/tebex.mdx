    ### Configure your package details including name, pricing, description, and imagery. Then locate the ``Configure what your customers should receive upon purchasing this package`` area and select ``Game Server Command``.

    ### Choose the game server you've connected to Tebex from the ``Game Server`` dropdown menu.

    ### Press the '`add command`' button in the bottom right corner.

    ### Insert the following command into the '`Enter the command`' field.

    ```txt copy
